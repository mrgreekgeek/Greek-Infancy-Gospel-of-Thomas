# About 
This is a public domain digital transcription of the Greek text of Tischendorf's "EVANGELIUM THOMAE GRAECE A." published in the book _Evangelia Apocrypha_ in 1853, available on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_XfU2AAAAMAAJ/page/n227/).
The OCR wasn't very good, so it's currently in the process of being cleaned up. 

# Cleanup Progress
19/19 chapters are finished with basic typo/diacritics corrections.

# Canonicity
Obviously, since this work is part of the "Apocrypha" it should **not** be considered inspired or authoritative. MrGreekGeek does not _recommend_ this work for any purpose other than some easy Greek reading for Greek students who want something to read that they're not already very familiar with. Treat this as imaginative fiction, and go to the Bible for your truth and doctrine and genuine history about Jesus.
